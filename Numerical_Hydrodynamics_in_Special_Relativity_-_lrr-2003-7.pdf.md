Abstract
This review is concerned with a discussion of numerical methods for the solution of the
equations of special relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD). Particular emphasis is put on a comprehensive review of the application of high-resolution shock-capturing methods in SRHD.
Results of a set of demanding test bench simulations obtained with different numerical SRHD
methods are compared. Three applications (astrophysical jets, gamma-ray bursts and heavy
ion collisions) of relativistic flows are discussed. An evaluation of various SRHD methods is
presented, and future developments in SRHD are analyzed involving extension to general relativistic hydrodynamics and relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics. The review further provides
FORTRAN programs to compute the exact solution of a 1D relativistic Riemann problem
with zero and nonzero tangential velocities, and to simulate 1D relativistic flows in Cartesian
Eulerian coordinates using the exact SRHD Riemann solver and PPM reconstruction.
